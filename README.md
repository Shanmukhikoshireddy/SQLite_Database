# SQLite_Database
This Project demonstrates a simple sales analysis using an in-memory SQLite database. It inserts sample sales data, calculates total quantity sold and revenue per product using SQL, and visualizes the results with a bar chart using matplotlib. Ideal for learning how to combine SQL, pandas, and data visualization in one workflow.
